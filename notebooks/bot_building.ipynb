Make a Plan and Prep ScheduleOne of the best ways to meal prep is to set aside an hour or two every week to draft a meal plan and build your shopping list. Mia Syn, MS, RDN, the owner of\\xa0Nutrition by Mia\\xa0in Charleston, South Carolina, recommends penciling it into your calendar and treating it as a priority — just as you would an important date or work meeting.Additionally, Palinski-Wade suggests allocating separate time for post-shopping prep — whether that’s simply cutting vegetables into snack-ready slices, or cooking whole batch-style freezer meals. Find what works for you and stick to it, and over time you’ll create a good habit that’s second nature.'),\n",

How long you spend doing prep work is up to you and your schedule, but here are a few food items you can start with.Fruits and Vegetables Turoff recommends prepping produce as soon as you get home from the grocery store. “Wash it, cut it, and put it in containers so it’s ready to go. That way, when the week gets crazy, it’s one less thing you have to do,” she says. Chopped fruits and vegetables are great for adding to salads, stir-fries, and fajitas, or on their own as a quick snack, with or without condiments and dips.Whole Grains\\xa0“I love preparing whole grains ahead of time that can be used in a variety of dishes,” Simon says. Throw together a batch of brown rice or farro, then use it in a handful of your recipes for the week. For example, have a farro salad for lunch or on the side with salmon.Meat and Meat Alternatives. Cooking meat and meat alternatives (like tofu or bean burgers) can be time-consuming. So save this task for a day when you don’t have a crammed schedule. Cook large batches so you have enough for multiple meals; freeze anything you won’t eat that week.RELATED: 10 Meal Prep Tips Every Beginner Should Follow'),\n",

The good news is that it's simpler than you might think. Here are some general tips.Stock Up On Fresh FoodsPurchase more fresh, in-season foods at the grocery store, following this\\xa0U.S. Department of Agriculture guide. A farmer’s market can make it easy by providing plenty of locally grown options. “When buying food, ask yourself: ‘How can I get as close to fresh and unprocessed as possible, and focus on seasonal ingredients?’” says Plumb. This process can be joyful as you speak to farmers or local purveyors, which can also reinforce your sense of community around eating, she says.Eat 3 Meals per DayReduce or eliminate snacking. This give your body enough time to digest the food you ate at the previous meal, rather than overloading your digestive system. Per ayurvedic diet principles, you might eat a small breakfast, followed by a bigger lunch, and a light dinner. Aim to eat an early dinner (at least three hours before bed) and then close the kitchen.Many people find they benefit from following the two principles above, says Weis-Bohlen. “You might find that that’s all you need to do,” she says. With an ayurvedic diet, “you can hit on the surface or go deeper.” If you want to do more, follow these next steps.Discover Your DoshaYou might be able to guess your constitution just by looking at the descriptors, but Weis-Bohlen recommends taking a dosha quiz or working with a certified ayurvedic practitioner. She recommends the quiz on Banyan Botanicals's site as a starting point.Learn About What Fuel Your Dosha NeedsIt’s all about helping to bring your body into balance, and you might do that by choosing foods that counteract imbalances in your dosha. Books on the ayurvedic diet can help you dive more deeply into this. LifeSpa’s website also offers guidance on how to balance a diet for each dosha: vata, pitta, and kapha.\")]"
